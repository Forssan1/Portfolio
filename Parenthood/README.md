## Game Description
PARENTHOOD explores the need to protect what is innocent and vulnerable. It tells you the story of love and growth, without a single word spoken.
<br/>
### Personal comment
I'm not very proud of the level of programming that i did in this game. However, it was very early in my coding journey and it was essential for learning.

# My Contributions During Development

## The child
So there were many challenges with making the movement of the child that will follow you while still acting like a child. With the obstacles there is also a need for situational behaviour depending on which obstacle was ahead. As the first proper project, this ended up being quite challenging.

| A sketch of obstacles | |
|---|---|
|In the beginning, it was expected that the child can move properly and expect help from you, the parent, just like in the sketch made by Axel Bj√∂rkman. <br/><br/> Some of the obstacles are:<br/> Jump up on ledge with help from parent. <br/> Stop at crushers giving the parent a chance to save the child. <br/> And child running away through a passage giving the parent a limited time to complete a task.| <img src="Images/ParenthoodSketch.png" width="800"/><br/> |

<br/>
<br/>

### The Ledges:
|||
|---|---|
| As quite newbie to coding the first idea that came to mind was to use RayCast to decide if the child was close enough to the step and after that use AddForce to make the child leap upwards over and over so that eventually the child clears the stairs. <br/> This of course is very flawed in many ways. The steps in every map varied in size making it difficult to predict the amount of force needed. It also could make the child stuck if it lands too far into each step.| |

| Simpler but better | |
|---|---|
| There were some more versions before this but in the end i decided that simpler was better and laid out points for each landing per each step. There were some minor things that needed fixing aswell. For example, the childs random jumping needed to be stopped before the approach of the steps. | <img src="Images/LedgeJump.gif" width="500"/><br/>|

### Assisted Jumps:
|Same as before||
|---|---|
|Similiar to the steps like before, there was another step for the child where it was too high for it to reach. For the child to make it over, the child needed help from the player/parent. <br/><br/> Before this task, we were taugh what DOTween was which help immensely with the solution. For this task i decided to check if the parent was next to the wall and then getting the top position of the parents collider. With that i made the child "jump" from it's original position to the top of the parent and after that using a bit of AddForce to make it completely over the ledge. | <img src="Images/LedgeJump2.gif" width="500">|

### Crushers:

|Protecting the child||
|---|---|
|We also wanted a obstacle that was dangerous instead of a simple step that the child can't jump over. Instead of adding something brutal like blades a simple crusher like in mario seemed like a good option. It was quite tricky to make it feel satisfying to save the child but i'm glad with the result.  | <img src="Images/Crusher.gif" width="500">|

## "Lonely" Shader
Due to there being some of play testers simply leaving the child and going ahead alone i decided to add something to discourage such actions. Since it was the early days of my game development journey i thought it would be fun to try out some shaders for the first time.

|First time using shaders||
|---|---|
|Although this shader isn't Shadertoy.com level it was enough to give the message to the player that they should go back. <br/><br/>  It calculates the position of the pixels from the origin and with a variable i increase or decrease the size of the mask i apply. A simple circle is a bit boring so i add some noise with a time node connected to the scale of the noise creating some variation. | <img src="Images/Lonely.gif" width="500">|
