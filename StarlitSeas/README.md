# My contributions during development

## The whales path
The whales ended up being the most complicated part for me.
<br/> 
The idea is simple. A simple "AI" that moves along a route 
<br/> 
but can still move around said routes to make it feel natural.
<br/> 

### The initial idea
At the beginning the initial thought was the Unreal Engines built in AI!
<br/> 
There was a problem with this. The AI required a nav mesh that only registers the potential path
<br/> 
on solid ground. I didn't manage to find any previous example of the built in Ai in the air either.
<br/> 
Having a invisible ground instead didn't give enough flexibilty that i wanted.
