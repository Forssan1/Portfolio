## Game Description
Ragnarok was just the beginningâ€¦ of the end! Odinfall is a Viking-themed, rogue-lite, twin-stick shooter. Blast your way through procedurally generated levels, upgrade your character, modify your weapons and take down robotic Norse gods to earn your freedom!

# Some of my contributions during development
Due to NDA i can't go much into detail to the code but i can give a brief description of a few features/systems i've worked on

<br/>

## Stats Tracker
I've designed and implemented systems for tracking player stats such as deaths, kills, which specific weapons have been picked up and most necessary stats for other systems to use. 

## Achievements
When a game has over 40 achievements as Odinfall has it gets quickly complicated with every scenario. Beside the statstracker i've developed a system which accounts for most scenarios so that every type (timed, specific bosses and so on) are all centralised to one location within the codebase

## Rich Presence
Altough rich presence isn't essential it's still a nice feature i've had the opportunity to develop for Odinfall. This way your friends on steam and Discord are able to see your progression within game.

### This list excludes the numerous bug fixes and polish tasks I contributed to during development.
